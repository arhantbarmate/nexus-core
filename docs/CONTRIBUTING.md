# Contributing to Nexus Protocol

Nexus Protocol enforces **strict architectural boundaries** to preserve protocol integrity.

## 1. Project Focus (Phase 1.3.1)
* **Perimeter Hardening:** Ensuring the Sentry correctly validates signatures before requests reach the Brain.
* **Adapter Standardization:** Building modular interfaces for chains like peaq, IoTeX, and TON.
* **Stateless UI Discipline:** Maintaining clear separation between visualization and economic authority.

## 2. Pull Requests
* **Atomic Scope:** One fix or one improvement per PR.
* **Sentry-Compliant:** Logic must not bypass the Sentry verification gate.
* **Phase Discipline:** Changes must align with the current Roadmap.

> **Note:** Non-conforming PRs may be closed without review to preserve architectural integrity.
