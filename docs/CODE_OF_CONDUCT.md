# 🤝 Code of Conduct — Nexus Protocol (v1.3.1)

Nexus is a professional DePIN ecosystem dedicated to architectural sovereignty and economic integrity. This Code of Conduct supplements GitHub’s Community Guidelines and applies specifically to Nexus Protocol development and operations.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Principles

1. **Sovereignty First:** We uphold the user's right to local execution and data ownership. Software should prioritize the local "Brain" over centralized cloud dependency.
2. **Integrity of the Invariant:** Respect the **60/30/10 Deterministic Split**. Any attempt to circumvent or obfuscate the protocol's economic distribution is considered incompatible with the core mission.
3. **Resilience over Hype:** We value verified engineering, documented stress tests, and durability-first development over speculative claims or marketing-driven roadmaps.

## 📜 Standards of Conduct

* **Technical Integrity:** Claims regarding performance, security, or decentralization must be supported by reproducible logs or code.
* **Professional Collaboration:** We maintain a focused, technical environment. Interactions should be constructive and aligned with the "Nexus Universal Hardening" objectives.
* **Transparency:** Document environmental assumptions (e.g., hardware requirements, ngrok usage) clearly to ensure fellow operators can reproduce sovereign states.
