# 🛡️ Ingress & Sentry Perimeter — Nexus Protocol
**Coreframe Systems Lab | Version 1.4.0**

This document defines the Sentry Perimeter, the hardened ingress layer that governs how all external requests enter a Nexus Sovereign Node. No request reaches the Brain without passing deterministic validation at this boundary.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Sentry
The Sentry exists to enforce **Fail-Closed Sovereignty**:
* Prevent unsolicited network access to the Brain.
* Terminate malformed or ambiguous identity contexts.
* Normalize all ingress traffic into a deterministic internal format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Sentry is not a load balancer or proxy. It is a logic gate.

## 🌐 The Cloudflare Zero Trust Loop
Nexus nodes run on operator-owned hardware. Traditional port forwarding is deprecated in favor of Zero Trust Tunnels.

| Feature | Port Forwarding | Zero Trust Tunnel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Public IP Exposure | ❌ Yes | ✅ No |
| DDoS Surface | ❌ Direct | ✅ Shielded |
| Router Config | ❌ Required | ✅ None |

**Trust Boundary:** Cloudflare terminates transport encryption.  
**Authority Boundary:** Nexus enforces identity and execution logic.

## 🔍 Header-Based Verification (Identity Resolution)
The Sentry performs context verification using headers only. If identity cannot be resolved (```403 Forbidden```), execution stops immediately.

## 🔄 Protocol Normalization
All ingress traffic (REST, WebSockets) is normalized into a Canonical Format:
```json
{
  "origin": "execution_surface",
  "identity_context": { ... },
  "payload": { ... },
  "timestamp": 1700000000
}
```
