# 🗺️ Protocol Roadmap — Nexus Protocol (v1.3.1)

The Nexus roadmap is an evolutionary sequence of technical milestones. We are currently in **Epoch I**, focusing on the verification of deterministic local execution.

---

## 📍 Epoch I: Sovereign Foundation (Current / Verified)
**Focus:** Local Edge Execution & Identity Perimeters
* **✅ Sentry Bridge:** Implementation of the $0-cost Sovereign Stack (Ngrok bypass + HMAC logic).
* **✅ Deterministic Brain:** Hardcoded 60/30/10 split invariant on local SQLite (WAL mode).
* **✅ Execution Surface:** Flutter-based UI with structural isolation via ```base-href```.
* **✅ Verification:** 50-user concurrent surge test verified on low-power local hardware.

## 🛰️ Epoch II: The Anchor Phase (Targeted / Dependency-Available)
**Focus:** External Verification & Adapter Boundaries
* **Identity Adapters:** Development of modular interfaces for external ID providers (e.g., peaq ID).
* **Proof of Uptime:** Researching off-chain verification methods (e.g., W3bstream) for node integrity.
* **State Root Anchoring:** Developing protocols to commit local ledger hashes to external chains for public auditability.
* **Sovereign Backup Bridge:** Operator-controlled, opt-in multi-device recovery for the Sovereign Vault (no automatic replication).

---

## 🌐 Epoch III: Network Sovereignty (Exploratory / Research)
**Focus:** DePIN Scaling & Policy Abstraction
* **Parameterized Invariants:** Transitioning the 60/30/10 split logic to allow parameterization by anchoring layers.
* **Nexus SDK (v0.1 Alpha):** Enabling external "Surfaces" to interact with the Sovereign Brain via standardized APIs.
* **Distributed Sentry Research:** Exploring peer-to-peer alternatives to the current tunnel-based connectivity stack.
* **Policy Execution Engine:** Allowing anchoring layers to define high-level economic rules for Nexus to execute locally.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This roadmap is non-binding and subject to technical feasibility, dependency availability, and ecosystem governance changes. Nexus defines **execution**, not **policy**.
