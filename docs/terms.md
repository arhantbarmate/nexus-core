# ⚖️ Terms of Service — Nexus Protocol (v1.3.1)

By deploying or interacting with a Nexus Sovereign Node, you acknowledge the decentralized and experimental nature of the protocol.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Node Operator Responsibility
The Operator is solely responsible for the hardware, security, and maintenance of their node. Nexus Protocol provides the software "as-is" and does not provide managed hosting or recovery services.

## 💰 2. Economic Invariants
The 60/30/10 split is a **Deterministic Local Rule**. Operators acknowledge that these splits are recorded on a local ledger. Future anchoring to external chains (peaq/IoTeX) will be subject to the terms and governance of those respective networks.

## 🛡️ 3. "Fail-Closed" Security
The protocol implements a **Fail-Closed** model. In the event of an authentication failure or Sentry Bridge interruption, the protocol will cease execution to protect the integrity of the Sovereign Vault.

## 🚫 4. No Liability
Nexus Protocol developers are not liable for any financial loss, data corruption, or hardware failure resulting from the use of this experimental software.
