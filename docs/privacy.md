# 🛡️ Data Sovereignty — Nexus Protocol
**Coreframe Systems Lab | Version 1.4.0**

Nexus is architected on the principle of **Absolute Data Sovereignty**. As a local-first gateway, the protocol ensures that data ownership remains strictly with the Node Operator. 

---

## 🔒 Local-First Persistence
* **Sovereign Vault:** All ledger entries, identity hashes, and transaction logs are stored in a local, encrypted-at-rest (optional) SQLite database (```nexus_vault.db```).
* **Zero Cloud Leakage:** The Nexus Brain does not transmit sensitive user data or economic state to centralized servers. All **60/30/10 splits** are computed and persisted locally on your own hardware.
* **Non-Custodial Integrity:** The protocol is a deterministic accounting engine. It does not custody private keys or external assets; it manages a local, unassailable ledger of truth.

## 🛰️ Identity & Hardened Ingress
* **Sentry Guard:** The perimeter extracts only the minimal environmental context required for identity resolution (e.g., cryptographic signatures or ```initData``` hashes). 
* **Tunneling Resilience:** Nexus utilizes ingress-agnostic header injection to maintain handshake integrity. This ensures that the node can communicate across public networks without exposing its internal structure to indexing or third-party data harvesting.

## ⚖️ Operator & User Rights
Users interacting with a Nexus Node are interacting directly with the Node Operator's sovereign hardware.
* **Zero Telemetry:** Coreframe Systems (the developers) does not include master keys, administrative backdoors, or telemetry reporting. We cannot see your data, your splits, or your uptime.
* **Auditability:** The local vault is 100% accessible to the operator via standard SQLite tools, ensuring total transparency of the **durability-first** ledger.
* **Compliance Responsibility:** As a sovereign tool, responsibility for compliance with local data regulations (GDPR/CCPA) rests with the Node Operator deploying the hardware.
