# 🛡️ Security Policy — Nexus Protocol (v1.3.1)

The Nexus Protocol is architected for **Sovereign Resilience**. We prioritize the integrity of the local ledger and the "Fail-Closed" security of the Sentry Bridge.

---

## 🔒 The Fail-Closed Model
* **Identity Validation:** If the Sentry Bridge detects an invalid HMAC or corrupted Signed Context, the transaction is rejected at the edge (403 Forbidden).
* **State Protection:** No writes are committed to the Sovereign Vault until the identity perimeter is cleared.

## 🛰️ Reporting a Vulnerability
Responsible disclosure is encouraged via:

* **Primary:** arhantbarmate@gmail.com
* **Secondary:** arhant6armate@outlook.com
