# 🧪 Research Adapters (Non-Production)

This directory serves as the cryptographic incubator for **Phase 2.0: Identity & Anchoring**. 

### 🛡️ Operational Status:
* **Production Status:** INACTIVE (Excluded from Phase 1.4.0 builds).
* **Cryptographic Status:** DRAFT (Verification logic is simulated).
* **Purpose:** To document interface compatibility and hardware-identity (DID) resolution requirements for **peaq** and **IoTeX**.

### 🚦 Promotion Criteria:
Adapters will only be promoted to the root `adapters/` directory after:
1. **Independent Cryptographic Audit:** Validation of Sr25519 and Ed25519 signature handlers.
2. **Integration Pass:** Successful 60/30/10 split validation via the Sovereign Brain.
3. **Threat Model Update:** Accounting for machine-identity spoofing vectors.
