# 🤝 Code of Conduct — Nexus Protocol
**Coreframe Systems Lab | Version 1.4.0**

The Nexus Protocol is a professional infrastructure environment dedicated to architectural sovereignty and economic integrity. This Code of Conduct governs all interactions within the Coreframe Systems ecosystem.

---

## 🛡️ Sovereign Principles

1. **Sovereignty First:** We uphold the user's right to local execution and absolute data ownership. Contributions must prioritize the local "Brain" and deterministic logic over centralized cloud dependencies.
2. **Integrity of the Invariant:** Respect the **60/30/10 Deterministic Split**. This is a hard-coded economic axiom. Any attempt to circumvent or obfuscate this distribution is incompatible with the Coreframe mission.
3. **Resilience over Hype:** We value verified engineering, documented stress tests, and durability-first development. Speculative claims or "vaporware" roadmaps are prohibited.

## 📜 Standards of Conduct

* **Technical Integrity:** Claims regarding performance, security, or decentralization must be supported by reproducible logs, code, or peer-reviewed benchmarks.
* **Professional Collaboration:** We maintain a high-signal, technical environment. Interactions must be constructive, evidence-based, and aligned with the "Universal Hardening" objectives.
* **Environmental Transparency:** Document all hardware assumptions and ingress requirements (e.g., Zero Trust Tunnels) clearly.

## 🤝 Professional Respect

Coreframe Systems maintains a harassment-free environment for contributors regardless of background, identity, or affiliation. Harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory behavior are not tolerated. Enforcement actions may include contribution rejection, access revocation, or permanent removal from project spaces. 

**This policy exists to protect technical focus and professional collaboration.**
