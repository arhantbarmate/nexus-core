# Code of Conduct - Nexus Protocol

## 1. Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and learning from mistakes.
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

Community leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, and issues that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
